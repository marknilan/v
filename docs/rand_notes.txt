RAND notes

at least use this?
fn intn #
fn intn(max int) !int
intn returns a uniformly distributed pseudorandom 32-bit
signed positive int in range [0, max).

WTF is this? Pseudo Random Number Generator
interface PRNG {
mut:
	seed(seed_data []u32)
	u8() u8
	u16() u16
	u32() u32
	u64() u64
	block_size() int
	free()
}

THEN - Use this is loops?
fn new_default #
fn new_default(config_ config.PRNGConfigStruct) &PRNG
new_default returns a new instance of the default RNG. If the seed 
is not provided, the current time will be used to seed the instance.


random element from array
fn element[T](array []T) !T


choose? 
choose samples k elements from the array without replacement. 
This means the indices cannot repeat and it restricts the 
sample size to be less than or equal to the size of the given 
array. Note that if the array has repeating elements, then
the sample may have repeats as well.

AND THIS ONE?

fn sample #
fn sample[T](array []T, k int) []T
sample samples k elements from the array with replacement. 
This means the elements can repeat and the size of the sample 
may exceed the size of the array.
