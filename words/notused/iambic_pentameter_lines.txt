TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION
WHETHER IT IS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER
THE MIRACLE THAT BRINGS ANOTHER DAY
THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE
OR TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES
BUT LYRICAL THE DAWN IS ON ITS WAY
AND BY OPPOSING END THEM TO DIEâ€”TO SLEEP
NO MORE AND BY A SLEEP TO SAY WE END
THE HEART ACHE AND THE THOUSAND NATURAL SHOCKS
THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO IT IS A CONSUMMATION
DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED TO DIE TO SLEEP
TO SLEEP PERCHANCE TO DREAM THERE IS THE RUB
FOR IN THAT SLEEP OF DEATH WHAT DREAMS MAY COME
WHEN WE HAVE SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL
MUST GIVE US PAUSE THERE IS THE RESPECT
THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG LIFE
OF MANS FIRST DISOBEDIENCE AND THE FRUIT
OF THAT FORBIDDEN TREE WHOSE MORTAL TASTE
BROUGHT DEATH INTO THE WORLD AND ALL OUR WOE
WITH LOSS OF EDEN TILL ONE GREATER MAN
MY FEARS HISTORICAL COME OUT TO PLAY
RESTORE US AND REGAIN THE BLISSFUL SEAT
SING HEAVENLY MUSE THAT ON THE SECRET TOP
THAT SHEPHERD WHO FIRST TAUGHT THE CHOSEN SEED
IN THE BEGINNING HOW THE HEAVENS AND EARTH
KNOW THEN THYSELF PRESUME NOT GOD TO SCAN
THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN
PLACED ON THIS ISTHMUS OF A MIDDLE STATE
A BEING DARKLY WISE AND RUDELY GREAT
WITH TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE FOR THE SCEPTIC SIDE
WITH TOO MUCH WEAKNESS FOR THE STOIC PRIDE
HE HANGS BETWEEN IN DOUBT TO ACT OR REST
IN DOUBT TO DEEM HIMSELF A GOD OR BEAST
IN DOUBT HIS MIND OR BODY TO PREFER
BORN BUT TO DIE AND REASONING BUT TO ERR
ALIKE IN IGNORANCE HIS REASON SUCH
WHETHER HE THINKS TOO LITTLE OR TOO MUCH
FIVE YEARS HAVE PAST FIVE SUMMERS WITH THE LENGTH
OF FIVE LONG WINTERS AND AGAIN I HEAR
THESE WATERS ROLLING FROM THEIR MOUNTAIN SPRINGS
WITH A SOFT INLAND MURMUR ONCE AGAIN
TYRANNICAL THE NIGHT EXERTS ITS SWAY
DO I BEHOLD THESE STEEP AND LOFTY CLIFFS
THAT ON A WILD SECLUDED SCENE IMPRESS
THOUGHTS OF MORE DEEP SECLUSION AND CONNECT
THE LANDSCAPE WITH THE QUIET OF THE SKY
OF WRITING MANY BOOKS THERE IS NO END
AND I WHO HAVE WRITTEN MUCH IN PROSE AND VERSE
FOR OTHERS USES WILL WRITE NOW FOR MINE
WILL WRITE MY STORY FOR MY BETTER SELF
AND ORACLES OF DOOM WILL NOT GAINSAY
AS WHEN YOU PAINT YOUR PORTRAIT FOR A FRIEND
WHO KEEPS IT IN A DRAWER AND LOOKS AT IT
LONG AFTER HE HAS CEASED TO LOVE YOU JUST
TO HOLD TOGETHER WHAT HE WAS AND IS
IT MAY BE THAT THE GULFS WILL WASH US DOWN
IT MAY BE WE SHALL TOUCH THE HAPPY ISLES
AND SEE THE GREAT ACHILLES WHOM WE KNEW
THOUGH MUCH IS TAKEN MUCH ABIDES AND THOUGH
WE ARE NOT NOW THAT STRENGTH WHICH IN OLD DAYS
MOVED EARTH AND HEAVEN THAT WHICH WE ARE WE ARE
ONE EQUAL TEMPER OF HEROIC HEARTS
MADE WEAK BY TIME AND FATE BUT STRONG IN WILL
TO STRIVE TO SEEK TO FIND AND NOT TO YIELD
TURNING AND TURNING IN THE WIDENING GYRE
THE FALCON CANNOT HEAR THE FALCONER
THINGS FALL APART THE CENTRE CANNOT HOLD
MERE ANARCHY IS LOOSED UPON THE WORLD
THE BLOOD DIMMED TIDE IS LOOSED AND EVERYWHERE
THE CEREMONY OF INNOCENCE IS DROWNED
THE BEST LACK ALL CONVICTION WHILE THE WORST
ARE FULL OF PASSIONATE INTENSITY NOW
NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER BY THIS SUN OF YORK
AND ALL THE CLOUDS THAT LANDED UPON OUR HOUSE
IN THE DEEP BOSOM OF THE OCEAN BURIED
HENCEFORTH BE EARLS THE FIRST THAT EVER SETTLED
IN SUCH AN HONOUR NAMED WHATS MORE TO DO
WHICH WOULD BE PLANTED NEWLY WITH THE TIME
AS CALLING HOME OUR EXILED FRIENDS ABROAD
THAT FLED THE SNARES OF WATCHFUL TYRANNY
PRODUCING FORTH THE CRUEL MINISTERS
OF THIS DEAD BUTCHER AND HIS FIEND LIKE QUEEN
WHO AS IT IS THOUGHT BY SELF AND VIOLENT HANDS
TOOK OFF HER LIFE THIS AND WHAT NEEDFUL ELSE
THAT CALLS UPON US BY THE GRACE OF GRACE
WE WILL PERFORM IN MEASURE TIME AND PLACE
SO THANKS TO ALL AT ONCE AND TO EACH ONE
WHOM WE INVITE TO SEE US CROWNED AT HOME
OH THAT THIS TOO TOO SOLID FLESH WOULD MELT
THAW AND RESOLVE ITSELF INTO A DEW
OR THAT THE EVERLASTING HAD NOT FIXED
HIS CANON AGAINST SELF SLAUGHTER OH GOD OH GOD
IF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF LOVE PLAY ON
GIVE ME EXCESS OF IT THAT SURFEIT
THE APPETITE MAY SICKEN, AND SO DIE
THAT STRAIN AGAIN IT HAD A DYING FALL
OH IT CAME OVER MY EAR LIKE THE SWEET SOUND
THAT BREATHES UPON A BANK OF VIOLETS
STEALING AND GIVING ODOUR ENOUGH NO MORE
IT IS NOT SO SWEET NOW AS IT WAS BEFORE
WHEN I DO COUNT THE CLOCK THAT TELLS THE TIME
AND SEE THE BRAVE DAY SUNK IN HIDEOUS NIGHT
WHEN I BEHOLD THE VIOLET PAST PRIME
AND SABLE CURLS ALL SILVERED OVER WITH WHITE
