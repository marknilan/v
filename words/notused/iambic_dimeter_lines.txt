THE BAT COME IN
IN AN ASHEN FLUME
OF CHIMNEY DUST
THE DOOR AJAR
THE WINDOW TOO
THE BAT FLIES BY
BUT WONT GO THROUGH
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT ITS LOOKING FOR
THE OTHER DOOR
BEFORE IT GOES
IT AUDIBLY SINGS
AND LEAVES FOR ME
ITS SOFT BROWN WINGS
THE WAY A CROW
SHOOK DOWN ON ME
THE DUST OF SNOW
FROM A HEMLOCK TREE
HAS GIVEN MY HEART
A CHANGE OF MOOD
AND SAVED SOME PART
OF A DAY I HAD RUED
HALF A LEAGUE 
HALF A LEAGUE ONWARD 
ALL IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH 
RODE THE SIX HUNDRED 
FORWARD THE LIGHT BRIGADE 
CHARGE FOR THE GUNS HE SAID 
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH 
RODE THE SIX HUNDRED 
WAS THERE A MAN DISMAYED 
NOT THOUGH THE SOLDIER KNEW 
SOME ONE HAD BLUNDERED 
THEIRS NOT TO MAKE REPLY 
THEIRS NOT TO REASON WHY 
THEIRS BUT TO DO AND DIE 
CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM 
CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM 
CANNON IN FRONT OF THEM 
VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED 
STORMED AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL 
BOLDLY THEY RODE AND WELL 
INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH 
INTO THE MOUTH OF HELL 
FLASHED ALL THEIR SABRES BARE 
FLASHED AS THEY TURNED IN AIR 
PLUNGED IN THE BATTERY SMOKE 
RIGHT THROUGH THE LINE THEY BROKE 
SHATTERED AND SUNDERED 
WHILE HORSE AND HERO FELL 
THEY THAT HAD FOUGHT SO WELL 
WHEN CAN THEIR GLORY FADE 
OH THE WILD CHARGE THEY MADE 
ALL THE WORLD WONDERED 
HONOUR THE CHARGE THEY MADE 
HONOUR THE LIGHT BRIGADE
PATTY CAKE PATTY CAKE
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
OF THE AFRICAN QUEEN
DUTIES REQUIRE MY
PRESENCE IN EGYPT 
YA KNOW WHAT 
I MEAN YOU 
SWEET DAY 
SO COOL
SO CALM
SO BRIGHT
THE BRIDAL OF THE EARTH AND SKY
THE DEW SHALL WEEP THY FALL TONIGHT
FOR THOU MUST DIE
WHAT ARE VICES 
CATCHING RATS
AND EATING MICE
HAS FOUND OUT YOUR BED 
OF CRIMSON JOY 
AND HIS DARK SECRET LOVE 
DOES THY LIFE DESTROY
A SIMPLE CHILD
THAT LIGHTLY DRAWS ITS BREATH
AND FEELS ITS LIFE IN EVERY LIMB
WHAT SHOULD IT KNOW OF DEATH
MY HEART ACHES
AND A DROWSY NUMBNESS PAINS
MY SENSE
AS THOUGH OF HEMLOCK
I HAD DRUNK
OR EMPTIED SOME DULL
OPIATE TO THE DRAINS
ONE MINUTE PAST
AND LEAST WARDS HAD SUNK
WHEN UP ALOFT
I FLY AND FLY
I SEE IN POOLS
THE SHINING SKY
AND A HAPPY BIRD
AM I AM I
ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE
WEARY OF BREATH
RASHLY IMPORTUNATE
GONE TO HER DEATH
TAKE HER UP TENDERLY
LIFT HER WITH CARE
FASHIONED SO SLENDERLY
YOUNG AND SO FAIR
LOOK AT HER GARMENTS
CLINGING LIKE GLUE
WHILST THE WAVE CONSTANTLY
DRIPS FROM HER CLOTHING
TAKE HER UP INSTANTLY
LOVING NOT LOATHING
TOUCH HER NOT SCORNFULLY
THINK OF HER MOURNFULLY
GENTLY AND HUMANLY
NOT OF THE STAINS OF HER
ALL THAT REMAINS OF HER
NOW IS PURE WOMANLY
MAKE NO DEEP SCRUTINY
INTO HER MUTINY
RASH AND UNDUTIFUL
PAST ALL DISHONOUR
DEATH HAS LEFT ON HER
ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL
STILL FOR ALL SLIPS OF HERS
ONE OF EVENING FAMILY
WIPE THOSE POOR LIPS OF HERS
OOZING SO CALMLY
LOOP UP HER TRESSES
ESCAPED FROM THE COMB
HER FAIR AUBURN TRESSES
WHILST WONDERMENT GUESSES
WHERE WAS HER HOME
WHO WAS HER FATHER
WHO WAS HER MOTHER
HAD SHE A SISTER
HAD SHE A BROTHER
OR WAS THERE A DEARER ONE
STILL AND A NEARER ONE
YET THAN ALL OTHER
ALAS FOR THE RARITY
OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY
UNDER THE SUN
OH IT WAS PITIFUL
NEAR A WHOLE CITY FULL
HOME SHE HAD NONE
SISTERLY BROTHERLY
FATHERLY MOTHERLY
FEELINGS HAD CHANGED
LOVE BY HARSH EVIDENCE
THROWN FROM ITS EMINENCE
EVEN GOD PROVIDENCE
SEEMING ESTRANGED
WHERE THE LAMPS QUIVER
SO FAR IN THE RIVER
WITH MANY A LIGHT
FROM WINDOW AND CASEMENT
FROM GARRET TO BASEMENT
SHE STOOD WITH AMAZEMENT
HOUSELESS BY NIGHT
THE BLEAK WIND OF MARCH
MADE HER TREMBLE AND SHIVER
BUT NOT THE DARK ARCH
OR THE BLACK FLOWING RIVER
MAD FROM LIFE HISTORY
GLAD TO DEATH MYSTERY
SWIFT TO BE HURLED
ANYWHERE ANYWHERE
OUT OF THE WORLD
IN SHE PLUNGED BOLDLY
NO MATTER HOW COLDLY
THE ROUGH RIVER RAN
OVER THE BRINK OF IT
PICTURE IT THINK OF IT
DISSOLUTE MAN
LAVE IN IT DRINK OF IT
THEN IF YOU CAN
