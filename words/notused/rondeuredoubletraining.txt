THE SAME TO ME ARE SOMBRE DAYS AND GAY
THOUGH JOYOUS DAWNS THE ROSY MORN AND BRIGHT
BECAUSE MY DEAREST LOVE IS GONE AWAY
WITHIN MY HEART IS MELANCHOLY NIGHT
MY HEART BEATS LOW IN LONELINESS DESPITE
THAT RIOTOUS SUMMER HOLDS THE EARTH IN SWAY
IN CEREMENTS MY SPIRIT IS BEDIGHT
THOUGH BREEZES IN THE RIPPLING GRASSES PLAY
AND WAVES DASH HIGH AND FAR IN GLORIOUS MIGHT
I THRILL NO LONGER TO THE SPARKLING DAY
THOUGH JOYOUS DAWNS THE ROSY MORN AND BRIGHT
UNGRACEFUL SEEMS TO ME THE SWALLOW'S FLIGHT
AS WELL MIGHT HEAVEN'S BLUE BE SULLEN GRAY
MY SOUL DISCERNS NO BEAUTY IN THEIR SIGHT
BECAUSE MY DEAREST LOVE IS GONE AWAY
LET ROSES FLING AFAR THEIR CRIMSON SPRAY
AND VIRGIN DAISIES SPLASH THE FIELDS WITH WHITE
LET BLOOM THE POPPY HOTLY AS IT MAY
WITHIN MY HEART IS MELANCHOLY NIGHT
AND THIS OH LOVE MY PITIABLE PLIGHT
WHENEVER FROM MY CIRCLING ARMS YOU STRAY
THIS LITTLE WORLD OF MINE HAS LOST ITS LIGHT 
I HOPE TO GOD MY DEAR THAT YOU CAN SAY
THE SAME TO ME
