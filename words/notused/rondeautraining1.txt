COME FOLLOW ME I WILL LEAD YOU WHERE
THE DAYS ARE FINE AND NIGHTS ARE FAIR
WHERE FIELDS OF CLOVER LUSH AND GREEN
WILL VISIT YOU WITHIN THIS SCENE
AS MARCH INHALES THE SPRINGTIME AIR
SO COME WITH ME AND WE SHALL SHARE
THE FRESHNESS SPRINGTIME CAN ENSNARE
AS FIELDS OF FLOWERS THUS CONVENE
SPRINGTIME APPROACH TO WHICH WE ARE HEIR
WILL BRING ABOUT WINTER REPAIR
WHERE WE SHALL WITNESS SIGHTS SERENE
AND GLORY IN THAT TO BE SEEN
NO OTHER SEASON CAN COMPARE
AS I WAS WARMED BY GOLDEN SUN
AND FELT ITS PEACE WHEN IT WAS DONE
A PATCH OF CLOVER BARELY SEEN
REFLECTED SUN IN JAUNTY GREEN
AS WINTER FELL AND SPRING HAD WON
I WATCHED THE CHILDREN LAUGH AND RUN
I FELT MY SPIRIT JOIN THEIR FUN
THE LIFTING OF A WINTER SCREEN
TIME CALLED FOR RAIN, BUT THERE WAS NONE.
A BRAND NEW SEASON HAD BEGUN
AND MARCH HAD PAINTED PASTEL SCENE
AS JACK FROST TRIED ONCE MORE TO GLEAN
A FINAL CHILL BUT FOUND NOT ONE
WINDS OF CHICKEN DO FIRMLY BLOW
THROUGH GREEN CLOVER FIELDS WHERE FIREFLIES GLOW
A MARCH SUNSET INKS THE DISTANT DULL SKY
MAPPING THE PATH OF NIGHT THE END DRAWS NIGH
DOWN WHERE THE MIGHTY RIVER DOES FLOW
STARS BRIGHTLY GAZE UPON THE EARTH BELOW
WINKING AT THE WAVES ROCKING TO AND FROM
WHERE LIGHT DARES NOT REACH WEEPING WILLOWS CRY
A BLEAK SIGN OF DAYBREAK BEGINS TO SHOW
JUST BEYOND THE CLOUDS HANGING SOFT AND LOW
THE EARLY BIRDS GRASP THE BREEZES ON HIGH
UP INTO THE MORNING THEIR SILHOUETTES FLY
OVER WHITE SAILING SHIPS CRUISING THE SLOW
